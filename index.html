        <h3>I'm majoring in Computer Science and minor in Entrepreneurship.</h3>
        <h3>My IP address is 192.168.1.198</h3>
        <h3>I grew up in Sacramento, CA.</h3>
        <h3>The fact that I am a computer science major now in college.
            It is because I was planning to be an international relations
            major and didn't start coding until freshman year!
